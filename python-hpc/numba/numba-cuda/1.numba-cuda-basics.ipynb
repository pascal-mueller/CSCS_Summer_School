    "# Using Numba for GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use Numba to generate GPU code from high-level Python functions. Both CUDA and ROCm GPUs (NVIDIA and AMD, respectively) are supported, but we are going to focus only on the CUDA capabilities of Numba.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The [Numba CUDA Target](https://github.com/NVIDIA/numba-cuda) is now developed separetely from the core Numba.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an almost one-to-one mapping between the Numba high-level Python abstractions and the different CUDA constructs. This practically means that, as a programmer, you need to take care explicitly of the host/device memory management and you need to be aware of the CUDA programming model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will teach you to write your first CUDA kernels using Numba. It will cover the basic CUDA programming principles, but it should be enough to kick start you in GPU programming. More specifically, we will cover the following topics:\n",

    "- Writing a GPU kernel\n",
    "- Moving data to/from the GPU.\n",
    "- Spawning a GPU kernel\n",
    "- Profiling a GPU kernel\n",

    "## Verify that Numba sees the GPUs and understands CUDA\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing is to check if Numba can detect the GPUs. You can achieve this by running the `numba` executable that comes with Numba's installation:"

    "\n",
    "The `@cuda.jit` decorator will compile the following function into a CUDA kernel at runtime. We will see the cost of it later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CUDA kernel in Numba is a Python function that does *not* return a value. This is in accordance with CUDA, where kernel functions are declared `void`. The arguments of the function can be either Numpy arrays or scalars of a Numba recognized type.\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA kernels specify the work to be done by a single GPU thread. Due to the massive hardware parallelism available on the GPU, a single GPU thread gets only a tiny portion of work, in this case, the sumation of a single element in the vectors. Since each element is independent from each other, we can safely create as many threads as the elements of the target vectors and spawn them (we will see how later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads on the GPU as organized in groups, called CUDA blocks. There are constraints on the maximum number of threads a block can contain. For the Hopper GPUs of each of the GH200 superchips of Alps, this is 1024. This means that you will need multiple blocks to calculate the sum of large vectors. The blocks that comprise a kernel form the *grid*. Threads inside a block are numbered sequentially and the blocks inside the grid are numbered, too. The figure below shows the arrangement of threads for the vector addition example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Arrangement of threads in CUDA blocks](figs/cuda-blocks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain the i-th element of the vector given a block size $B$, you would have to calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "i = i_{b}B + i_{t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i_{b}$ is the block index and $i_{t}$ is the thread index. CUDA provides this information and Numba makes it available, so that the above statement would be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = cuda.blockIdx.x*cuda.blockDim.x + threadIdx.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks and grids can be three dimensional, thus the `.x` attribute in all of these variables (the other dimensions are accessed through the `.y` and `.z` attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since obtaining the absolute position of a thread in a CUDA is quite common operation, Numba offers the convenience function `grid()`, which essentially does automatically the above calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = cuda.grid(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument passed to the `grid()` function is the number of dimensions of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next three statements in the code simply check that we don't overrun the arrays in case that their dimension is not a multiple of the block size. In this case, some threads of the last block will remain idle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    N = x.shape[0]\n",
    "    if i >= N:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The threads inside a block are run in batches of 32 at once, called *warps*. All the threads of the warp execute the same instruction. If the program control flow diverges for some of the threads of the warp, e.g., due to an `if` condition, the branches will be executed sequentially by disabling the non participating threads. This condition is called *warp divergence* and may incur a performance penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `z[i] = x[i] + y[i]` computes the actual sum.\n",

    "## Preparing the data for the GPU\n",
    "\n",
